things to accomplish in finishing app:
1. for entry form - the sub Carousel needs to behave like the parent Carousel. the parent Carousel hides, the sub shows and the JS takes command of the sub.

2. currently working on (active): getting to run on external server

3. UX-related - entry form, animal selected text could be fancier with shading and background picture dependent on animal category 

4. fix celeb pitures to not warp inside entry form window
	a) make so random is not same as previous
b) add five more entries to the celebs database in controllers

5. functionalize the done button to capture all entered data

6. functionalize openFace (future prospect)

7. when user uses camera mode from entry form, save any entered data so that when thet return, they won't have to reeneter the data.

8. make category images way cooler. semi-transparent with stylized lettering, not ASCII, but text images. 

9. get more sub category pictures especially for reptiles

10. initiate "celeb-matcher" mode to also include celebrities

11. include a "description" text input field on the form
