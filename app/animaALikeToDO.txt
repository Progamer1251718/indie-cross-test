things to accomplish in finishing app:
1. for entry form - the sub Carousel needs to behave like the parent Carousel. the parent Carousel hides, the sub shows and the JS takes command of the sub.

2. currently working on (active): getting to run on external server

3. UX-related - entry form, animal selected text could be fancier with shading and background picture dependent on animal category
